* Struggle a lot with the presentation of the numbers in the screen.
* Complete basics mathematical operation (add,subtract,divide,multiply).
* There is some error especially on:
    * Decimal insertion more than once on single number
    * Number is directly 'concat' after clicking on number "For example: 1+2=3, so the screen will show only '3' but when one the number buttons is clicked (assume clicked button "9"), it becomes '39' not '9'.
    * Calculation error if more than one operator stored inside array.
